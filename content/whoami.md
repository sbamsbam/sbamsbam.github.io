I have been working in the IT world for about 20 years, but I have been passionate about it long before, since my father gave me the first Commodore 16. I started repairing MFPs and printers, then as a second level help desk, system and network administrator and now here I am, as a pentester.

I am passionate about video games, music and vinyls. I practice extreme sports when I can get up from my chair and I am not busy at the BBQ.
